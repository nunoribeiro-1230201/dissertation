            Administration of the master's program, responsible for dissertation evaluation & Medium         & Low               \\ \hline
            Advisor                                                                         & High           & High              \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The master's program administration has moderate influence due to institutional requirements but potential interest in the outcomes, while the advisor holds the most significant influence and interest, as their guidance and approval are critical for project success.

\textbf{Benefits}

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Decision Support for Developers:}
            The project will provide a detailed analysis of fault tolerance aspects in Elixir, Go, and Scala with Akka, offering developers and system architects a practical guide to help them choose the most suitable language for specific fault-tolerant distributed systems scenarios.

      \item \textbf{Open Source Opportunities:}
            The findings could reveal areas for improvement in the evaluated languages, inspiring open-source developers to create libraries, frameworks, or enhancements tailored to fault tolerance in distributed environments.

      \item \textbf{Academic Contributions:}
            The dissertation will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the areas of distributed systems, fault tolerance, and microservices. It will provide insights into comparative aspects in the languages of debate.

\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Computational Resources:}
            It is assumed that the available computational resources, including hardware and software tools, will suffice to simulate the benchmarking scenarios for each language under realistic system conditions.

      \item \textbf{Support and Guidance:}
            The advisor will provide timely and effective feedback on each deliverable, ensuring alignment with project objectives.

      \item \textbf{Consistency Across Languages:}
            The chosen languages (Elixir, Go, Scala with Akka) have sufficient community support, libraries, and tools to implement the required benchmarking scenarios consistently.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work Breakdown Structure}

The objective of the \gls{WBS} is to detail the project scope in a visual and hierarchical manner, enabling a clear understanding of how each deliverable connects to the overall project \footnote{WBS Practice Standard: \url{https://www.projectmanagement.com/deliverables/311939/work-breakdown-structure–wbs–practice-standard-package/} (accessed 30 November 2024)}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:wbs}, the focal point of this project is the dissertation. With the objective defined, the first phase focuses on project planning. This phase establishes the foundation by outlining the project charter, creating a \gls{WBS}, and developing a timeline through a Gantt chart.

Once the planning phase is complete, the subsequent phases align with the Design and Creation research method. This research method was chosen given the nature of the project: while the final objective is clear, there are uncertainties about how to achieve each stage, as every step builds on the outcomes of the previous one. Consequently, the method divides the project into sequential phases: design, implementation, and conclusion. Each phase has clearly defined deliverables that align with the \gls{WBS}, ensuring that progress can be monitored and adjustments can be made as needed.

The final phase, the conclusion, consolidates all findings and results, translating them into the completed dissertation.

\section{Gantt Diagram}

\subsection{Project Management and Scheduling}

For project management, the start date was established as 02/02/2025, after the 1º semester exams. The scheduling mode was set to automated by adding up the days of each task. The schedule is based on a calendar with no restrictions on working days, meaning all days, including weekends, are considered working days to ensure continuous progress.

\textbf{Estimation Rationale.} Task duration estimates were determined based on the complexity and importance of each phase. The background and state-of-the-art sections were assigned the highest weights due to their critical role in forming the foundation of the research. These sections require extensive literature review and analysis, which are time-intensive. After completing the research phase, the design stage was given significant weight, as it involves defining requirements and developing a comprehensive testing plan, both of which are essential for a successful implementation.

The duration of the implementation phase was estimated considering the iterative nature of prototyping and testing triggers, ensuring sufficient time for observability and adjustments. The evaluation phase, particularly benchmarking results, was scheduled with adequate time to ensure thorough analysis and interpretation of the findings. Lastly, the conclusions phase was planned with sufficient time to synthesize the project outcomes and finalize the dissertation.

\textbf{Resource Allocation and Monitoring.} A resource table was included in the project plan to track resource allocation, focusing on the student and advisor as the primary stakeholders. The advisor’s role is pivotal in control and monitoring tasks, providing feedback and guidance throughout the project lifecycle.

\textbf{Cost Management.} The cost component was excluded from the project plan, as it is not applicable to this type of academic project, which primarily involves intellectual effort and existing institutional resources rather than financial expenditure.

\subsubsection{Monitoring and Controlling Procedures}

The strategy defined to have control over the progress of each task was to mark its progress by an estimated percentage of completion. This method ensures that the progress of the task is clearly visible and measurable, giving both the student and the advisor a view of progress, like it is possible to observe the “\% Completed” column on the Figure \ref{fig:gantt_monitoring}.

To improve this process, specific tasks dedicated to monitoring and control have been incorporated, such as \textit{“Validation and Refinement with the Advisor”}, like illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:gantt_monitoring}. These tasks have two main objectives, firstly, to make the student responsible for presenting the partial document ready to be assessed. Secondly, to ensure that the supervisor is warned in advance of the need for closer and more active feedback on these pre-defined days. Feedback can be given asynchronously via messages or synchronously during scheduled meetings. After the feedback time is up, the goal is to be able to present a refined partial document, referred to as the \textit{“Document version X”} task, also possible to observe on Figure \ref{fig:gantt_monitoring}.

Additionally, milestones have been defined to mark the completion of each significant project phase. These milestones serve as checkpoints to ensure progress is on track and can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:gantt_monitoring} under the main task \textit{“Milestones”}.

To manage potential delays, a baseline has been established. This baseline records the initial schedule, allowing deviations to be tracked throughout the project. This mechanism provides an overview of delays and their impact on the schedule. The \textit{“Variance”} column in Figure \ref{fig:gantt_monitoring} illustrates this feature, enabling a clear visualization of discrepancies between planned and actual progress.

\subsection{Meeting Sessions}

To ensure consistent communication and effective progress monitoring with the advisor, a series of biweekly meetings has been scheduled on Wednesdays, with each session expected to last between 30 minutes and one hour. While the schedule includes a predefined list of sessions, it remains flexible, allowing adjustments to the frequency of meetings as the project evolves. For instance, the number of meetings may increase during the final stages of the project, at which point the Gantt chart will be updated accordingly to reflect these changes.

\end{figure}

The meeting schedule is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gantt_meetings}, which includes 11 recurring tasks organized under the main task \textit{“Meeting Sessions”}. These meetings are planned to take place online, via Microsoft Teams, to ensure accessibility and convenience for both participants.

\subsection{Competencies Development Plan}

To address the competencies identified during the diagnosis of critical skills required for the completion of the dissertation, a dedicated section titled "Competencies Development Plan” has been incorporated into the project plan, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gantt_competency}. This section outlines targeted tasks designed to address these areas for improvement.

For stress management and resilience, the plan includes the completion of a "Managing Stress" course
\footnote{Managing Stress Course: \url{https://www.linkedin.com/learning/managing-stress-2019/}}
, which focuses on these critical skills. To enhance self-discipline and time management, the initial task involves identifying and installing at least one productivity application, such as tools that restrict smartphone usage during certain periods, for example. Additionally, time management will be further strengthened through the completion of "Time Management Fundamentals" course
\footnote{Time Management Fundamentals Course: \url{https://www.linkedin.com/learning/time-management-fundamentals-14548057/the-power-of-managing-your-time/}}.

Communication, another key area of focus, will be developed by attending to the "Communicating with Confidence" course
