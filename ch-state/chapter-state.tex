\section{Research Questions} 

- RQ1: How do the programming languages Elixir, Scala/Akka, and Go implement fault-tolerance mechanisms in distributed systems, and what are the comparative strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs of each approach?

- RQ2: What are the most effective benchmarking strategies for simulating distributed environments, and which metrics are most relevant for evaluating fault tolerance in these scenarios?
