The programming language used to construct the server has an important role in engineering efficient server software, and must support massive concurrency on multicore machines with low communication and synchronisation overheads. This paper investigates 12 highly concurrent programming languages suitable for engineering servers, and analyses three representative languages in detail: Erlang, Go, and Scala with Akka. We have designed three server benchmarks that analyse key performance characteristics of the languages. The benchmark results suggest that where minimising message latency is crucial, Go and Erlang are best; that Scala with Akka is capable of supporting the largest number of dormant processes; that for servers that frequently spawn processes Erlang and Go minimise creation time; and that for constantly communicating processes Go provides the best throughput.},

As distributed systems can be homogeneous (cluster) as well as heterogeneous (grid and cloud etc), they are prone to different kinds of problems. The issues in distributed systems can be Security, Quality of Service, Resource Selection and Fault Tolerance etc. Fault tolerance is responsible for handling the reliability and availability of distributed systems. It is not feasible to ignore job failures in distributed environments where long and persistent commitments of resources are required. In this paper we have presented a comprehensive classification of errors, failures and faults that can be encountered in a Distributed environment. Furthermore, we have examined different fault identification and tolerance techniques available in different Clustered and Grid Computing environments. Fault detection and tolerance techniques used in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments are different from each other and are not interoperable. We have proposed in this paper that a standard fault tolerant framework should be there capable of handling all the identified errors, failures and faults.},

Yet, writing distributed applications remains difficult because the programmer has to manage models of these areas explicitly. A major challenge is to integrate the four models into a coherent development platform. Such a platform shoUld make it possible to cleanly separate an application's functionality from the other four concerns. Concurrent constraint programming, an evolution of concurrent logic programming, has both the expressiveness and the formal foundation needed to attempt this integration. As a first step, we have designed and built a platform that separates an application's functionality from its distribution structure. We have prototyped several collaborative tools with this platform, including a shared graphic editor whose design is presented in detail. The platform efficiently implements Distributed Oz, which extends the Oz language with constructs to express the distribution structure and with basic primitives for open computing, failure detection and handling, and resource control. Oz appears to the programmer as a concurrent object-oriented language with dataflow synchronization. Oz is based on a higher-order, state-aware, concurrent constraint computation model.}

	abstract     = {Distributed actor languages are an effective means of constructing scalable reliable systems, and the Erlang programming language has a well-established and influential model. While the Erlang model conceptually provides reliable scalability, it has some inherent scalability limits and these force developers to depart from the model at scale. This article establishes the scalability limits of Erlang systems and reports the work of the EU RELEASE project to improve the scalability and understandability of the Erlang reliable distributed actor model. We systematically study the scalability limits of Erlang and then address the issues at the virtual machine, language, and tool levels. More specifically: (1) We have evolved the Erlang virtual machine so that it can work effectively in large-scale single-host multicore and NUMA architectures. We have made important changes and architectural improvements to the widely used Erlang/OTP release. (2) We have designed and implemented Scalable Distributed (SD) Erlang libraries to address language-level scalability issues and provided and validated a set of semantics for the new language constructs. (3) To make large Erlang systems easier to deploy, monitor, and debug, we have developed and made open source releases of five complementary tools, some specific to SD Erlang. Throughout the article we use two case studies to investigate the capabilities of our new technologies and tools: a distributed hash table based Orbit calculation and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO). Chaos Monkey experiments show that two versions of ACO survive random process failure and hence that SD Erlang preserves the Erlang reliability model. While we report measurements on a range of NUMA and cluster architectures, the key scalability experiments are conducted on the Athos cluster with 256 hosts (6,144 cores). Even for programs with no global recovery data to maintain, SD Erlang partitions the network to reduce network traffic and hence improves performance of the Orbit and ACO benchmarks above 80 hosts. ACO measurements show that maintaining global recovery data dramatically limits scalability; however, scalability is recovered by partitioning the recovery data. We exceed the established scalability limits of distributed Erlang, and do not reach the limits of SD Erlang for these benchmarks at this scale (256 hosts, 6,144 cores).},

First, it is one of a few functional languages that is used in industry. Secondly the programming language contains support for concurrency and distribution as well as including constructs for handling fault-tolerance. Erlang programmers, of course, mostly work with ready-made language components. Our approach to verification of fault tolerance is to verify systems built using two central components of most Erlang software, a generic server component with fault tolerance handling, and a supervisor component that restarts failed processes. To verify Erlang programs built using these components we automatically translate them into processes of the μCRL process algebra, generate their state spaces, and use a model checker to determine whether they satisfy correctness properties specified in the μ-calculus. The key observation of this paper is that, due to the usage of these higher-level design patterns (supervisors and generic servers) that structure process communication and fault recovery, the state space generated from a Erlang program, even with failures occurring, is relatively small, and can be generated automatically. Moreover the method is independent from the actual Erlang program studied, and is thus reusable. We demonstrate the approach in a case study where a server, built using the generic server component, implements a locking service for a number of client processes, and show that the server tolerates client failures.

Implementation of a fault tolerance policy in cloud not only needs specific knowledge of its application domain, but a comprehensive analysis of the background and various prevalent techniques also. Some recent surveys try to assimilate the various fault tolerance architectures and approaches proposed for cloud environment but seem to be limited on some accounts. This paper gives a systematic and comprehensive elucidation of different fault types, their causes and various fault tolerance approaches used in cloud. The paper presents a broad survey of various fault tolerance frameworks in the context of their basic approaches, fault applicability, and other key features. A comparative analysis of the surveyed frameworks is also included in the paper. For the first time, on the basis of an analysis of various fault tolerance frameworks cited in the present paper as well as included in the recently published prime surveys, a quantified view on their applicability is presented. It is observed that primarily the checkpoint-restart and replication oriented fault tolerance techniques are used to target the crash faults in cloud.},

Actor-based frameworks like Erlang are fundamentally scalable, but in practice they have some scalability limitations. The RELEASE project aims to scale the Erlang's radical concurrency-oriented programming paradigm to build reliable general-purpose software, such as server-based systems, on emergent commodity architectures with 10 4 cores. The RELEASE consortium works to scale Erlang at the virtual machine, language level, infrastructure levels, and to supply profiling and refactoring tools. This research contributes to the RELEASE project at the language level. Firstly, we study the provision of scalable persistent storage options for Erlang. We articulate the requirements for scalable and available persistent storage, and evaluate four popular Erlang DBMSs against these requirements. We investigate the scalability limits of the Riak NoSQL DBMS using Basho Bench up to 100 nodes on the Kalkyl cluster and establish for the first time scientifically the scalability limit of Riak as 60 nodes, thereby confirming developer folklore. We design and implement DE-Bench, a scalable fault-tolerant peer-to-peer benchmarking tool that measures the throughput and latency of distributed Erlang commands on a cluster of Erlang nodes. We employ DE-Bench to investigate the scalability limits of distributed Erlang on up to 150 nodes and 1200 cores. Our results demonstrate that the frequency of global commands limits the scalability of distributed Erlang. We also show that distributed Erlang scales linearly up to 150 nodes and 1200 cores with relatively heavy data and computation loads when no global commands are used. As part of the RELEASE project, the Glasgow University team has developed Scalable Distributed Erlang (SD Erlang) to address the scalability limits of distributed Erlang. We evaluate SD Erlang by designing and implementing the first ever demonstrators for SD Erlang, i.e. DE-Bench, Orbit and Ant Colony Optimisation(ACO). We employ DE-Bench to evaluate the performance and scalability of group operations in SD-Erlang up to 100 nodes. Our results show that the alternatives SD-Erlang offers for global commands (i.e. group commands) scale linearly up to 100 nodes. We also develop and evaluate an SD-Erlang implementation of Orbit, a symbolic computing kernel and a generalization of a transitive closure computation. Our evaluation results show that SD Erlang Orbit outperforms the distributed Erlang Orbit on 160 nodes and 1280 cores. Moreover, we develop a reliable distributed version of ACO and show that the reliability of ACO limits its scalability in traditional distributed Er-lang. We use SD-Erlang to improve the scalability of the reliable ACO by eliminating global commands and avoiding full mesh connectivity between nodes. We show that SD Erlang reduces the network traffic between nodes in an Erlang cluster effectively.},

Our library is agnostic regarding what other testing/execution/formal verification tool uses the scheduler, and instruments Elixir code running under the scheduler through use of the Elixir macro facility. Moreover, the library provides a number of algorithms to explore the state space of the concurrent programs under study, including random search, depth-first search (potentially capable of exploring the whole state space of the program-under-study), and a novel search algorithm which selects schedules randomly.

Maintaining the correctness and integrity of MPI application execution is critical, especially for safety-critical scientific applications. Therefore, a collection of effective MPI fault tolerance techniques have been proposed to enable MPI application execution to efficiently resume from system failures. However, there is no structured way to study and compare different MPI fault tolerance designs, so to guide the selection and development of efficient MPI fault tolerance techniques for distinct scenarios. To solve this problem, we design, develop, and evaluate a benchmark suite called MATCH to characterize, research, and comprehensively compare different combinations and configurations of MPI fault tolerance designs. Our investigation derives useful findings: (1) Reinit recovery in general performs better than ULFM recovery; (2) Reinit recovery is independent of the scaling size and the input problem size, whereas ULFM recovery is not; (3) Using Reinit recovery with FTI checkpointing is a highly efficient fault tolerance design.

Understanding the system's communication topology and reasoning about concurrent activities of system hosts can be difficult. The standard approach, analyzing system logs, can be a tedious and complex process that involves reconstructing a system log from multiple hosts' logs, reconciling timestamps among hosts with non-synchronized clocks, and understanding what took place during the execution encoded by the log. This article presents a novel approach for tackling three tasks frequently performed during analysis of distributed system executions: (1) understanding the relative ordering of events, (2) searching for specific patterns of interaction between hosts, and (3) identifying structural similarities and differences between pairs of executions. Our approach consists of XVector, which instruments distributed systems to capture partial ordering information that encodes the happens-before relation between events, and ShiViz, which processes the resulting logs and presents distributed system executions as interactive time-space diagrams. Two user studies with a total of 109 students and a case study with 2 developers showed that our method was effective, helping participants answer statistically significantly more system-comprehension questions correctly, with a very large effect size.},

A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.

	abstract     = {The design of distributed systems in multiple clouds have been gaining popularity due to various benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as minimizing vendor lock-in, data loss and downtime. Nonetheless, this multi-cloud infrastructure also poses several challenges such as compatibility, interoperability, complex provisioning and configuration due to the variation in technologies and services of each cloud provider. Consequently, it is a tedious task to design distributed systems in multiple clouds. Virtualization is regarded as the base technology of the cloud and therefore, most cloud-based distributed systems are based on it. Nevertheless, virtual machines require substantial resources and cause several issues across multiple clouds such as provisioning, configuration management, load balancing and migration. Docker Swarm is a container-based clustering tool that resolves some of these issues and supports the design of distributed systems in multiple clouds. It has also incorporated several inbuilt attributes of the distributed system, however, it is still evolving. This paper initially presents the simulated development of a Docker Swarm-based distributed system which can be easily replicated in multiple clouds. Subsequently, based on the simulated Docker Swarm-based distributed system, it performs an evaluation of several attributes of this distributed system such as high availability and fault tolerance; automatic scalability, load balancing and maintainability of services; and scalability of large clusters.},

Through technological advancements and their changing role in society, distributed systems have undergone a perpetual evolution, with each change resulting in the formation of a new paradigm. Each new distributed system paradigm—of which modern prominence include cloud computing, Fog computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT)—allows for new forms of commercial and artistic value, yet also ushers in new research challenges that must be addressed in order to realize and enhance their operation. However, it is necessary to precisely identify what factors drive the formation and growth of a paradigm, and how unique are the research challenges within modern distributed systems in comparison to prior generations of systems. The objective of this work is to study and evaluate the key factors that have influenced and driven the evolution of distributed system paradigms, from early mainframes, inception of the global inter-network, and to present contemporary systems such as edge computing, Fog computing and IoT. Our analysis highlights assumptions that have driven distributed systems appear to be changing, including (1) an accelerated fragmentation of paradigms driven by commercial interests and physical limitations imposed by the end of Moore’s law, (2) a transition away from generalized architectures and frameworks towards increasing specialization, and (3) each paradigm architecture results in some form of pivoting between centralization and decentralization coordination. Finally, we discuss present day and future challenges of distributed research pertaining to studying complex phenomena at scale and the role of distributed systems research in the context of climate change.},

	abstract     = {Software's reliability in distributed systems has always been a major concern for all stake holders especially for application's vendors and its users. Various models have been produced to assess or predict reliability of large scale distributed applications including e-government, e-commerce, multimedia services, and end-to-end automotive solutions, but reliability issues with these systems still exists. Ensuring distributed system's reliability in turns requires examining reliability of each individual component or factors involved in enterprise distributed applications before predicting or assessing reliability of whole system, and Implementing transparent fault detection and fault recovery scheme to provide seamless interaction to end users. For this reason we have analyzed in detail existing reliability methodologies from viewpoint of examining reliability of individual component and explained why we still need a comprehensive reliability model for applications running in distributed system. In this paper we have described detailed technical overview of research done in recent years in analyzing and predicting reliability of large scale distributed applications in four parts. We first described some pragmatic requirements for highly reliable systems and highlighted significance and various issues of reliability in different computing environment such as Cloud Computing, Grid Computing, and Service Oriented Architecture. Then we elucidated certain possible factors and various challenges that are nontrivial for highly reliable distributed systems, including fault detection, recovery and removal through testing or various replication techniques. Later we scrutinize various research models which synthesize significant solutions to tackle possible factors and various challenges in predicting as well as measuring reliability of software applications in distributed systems. At the end of this paper we have discussed limitations of existing models and proposed future work for predicting and analyzing reliability of distributed applications in real environment in the light of our analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Morpheus introduces conflict analysis to further improve randomized testing by predicting and focusing on operations that affect the testing result. Inspired by the recent shift in building distributed systems using higher-level languages and frameworks, Morpheus targets Erlang. Evaluation on four popular distributed systems in Erlang including RabbitMQ, a message broker service, and Mnesia, a distributed database in the Erlang standard libraries, shows that Morpheus is effective: It found previously unknown errors in every system checked, 11 total, all of which are flaws in their core protocols that may cause deadlocks, unexpected crashes, or inconsistent states.},

In this paper, we investigate the paradigms of synchronous and asynchronous interaction in the context of distributed systems. We investigate to what extent or under which conditions synchronous interaction is a valid concept for specification and implementation of such systems. We choose Petri nets as our system model and consider different notions of distribution by associating locations to elements of nets. First, we investigate the concept of simultaneity which is inherent in the semantics of Petri nets when transitions have multiple input places. We assume that tokens may only be taken instantaneously by transitions on the same location. We exhibit a hierarchy of `asynchronous' Petri net classes by different assumptions on possible distributions. Alternatively, we assume that the synchronisations specified in a Petri net are crucial system properties. Hence transitions and their preplaces may no longer placed on separate locations. We then answer the question which systems may be implemented in a distributed way without restricting concurrency, assuming that locations are inherently sequential. It turns out that in both settings we find semi-structural properties of Petri nets describing exactly the problematic situations for interactions in distributed systems.}

These algorithms are notoriously difficult to implement correctly, due to asynchronous communication and the occurrence of faults, such as the network dropping messages or computers crashing. Nonetheless there is surprisingly little language and verification support to build distributed systems based on fault-tolerant algorithms. In this paper, we present some of the challenges that a designer has to overcome to implement a fault-tolerant distributed system. Then we review different models that have been proposed to reason about distributed algorithms and sketch how such a model can form the basis for a domain-specific programming language. Adopting a high-level programming model can simplify the programmer's life and make the code amenable to automated verification, while still compiling to efficiently executable code. We conclude by summarizing the current status of an ongoing language design and implementation project that is based on this idea.},

Underpinned by technological advancements, computer systems, far from being static, have been continuously evolving and adapting to cover multifaceted societal niches. This has led to new paradigms such as cloud, fog, edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which offer fresh economic and creative opportunities. Nevertheless, this rapid change poses complex research challenges, especially in maximizing potential and enhancing functionality. As such, to maintain an economical level of performance that meets ever-tighter requirements, one must understand the drivers of new model emergence and expansion, and how contemporary challenges differ from past ones. To that end, this article investigates and assesses the factors influencing the evolution of computing systems, covering established systems and architectures as well as newer developments, such as serverless computing, quantum computing, and on-device AI on edge devices. Trends emerge when one traces technological trajectory, which includes the rapid obsolescence of frameworks due to business and technical constraints, a move towards specialized systems and models, and varying approaches to centralized and decentralized control. This comprehensive review of modern computing systems looks ahead to the future of research in the field, highlighting key challenges and emerging trends, and underscoring their importance in cost-effectively driving technological progress.}

When we want to assess systems to reason about them, i.e., to understand dependencies, analyze evolution trade-offs, or to verify conformance to the original blueprint, we must invest broad efforts. This becomes difficult when considering decentralized systems. Microservice-based systems are mainstream these days; however, to observe, understand, and manage these systems and their properties, we are missing fundamental tools that would derive various simplified system abstract perspectives. Microservices architecture characteristics yield many advantages to system operation; however, they bring challenges to their development and deployment lifecycles. Microservices urge a system-centric perspective to better reason about the system evolution and its quality attributes. This process review paper considers the current system analysis approaches and their possible alignment with automated system assessment or with human-centered approaches. We outline the necessary steps to accomplish holistic reasoning in decentralized microservice systems. As a contribution, we provide a roadmap for analysis and reasoning in microservice-based systems and suggest that various process phases can be decoupled through the introduction of system intermediate representation as the trajectory to provide various system-centered perspectives to analyze various system aspects. Furthermore, we cover different technical-based reasoning strategies and metrics in addition to the human-centered reasoning addressed through alternative visualization approaches. Finally, a system evolution is discussed from the perspective of such a reasoning process to illustrate the impact analysis evaluation over system changes.},

	abstract     = {Fault tolerance is becoming increasingly important for upcoming exascale systems, supporting distributed data processing, due to the expected decrease in the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). To ensure the availability, reliability, dependability, and performance of the system, addressing the fault tolerance challenge is crucial. It aims to keep the distributed system running at a reduced capacity while avoiding complete data loss, even in the presence of faults, with minimal impact on system performance. This comprehensive survey aims to provide a detailed understanding of the importance of fault tolerance in distributed systems, including a classification of faults, errors, failures, and fault-tolerant techniques (reactive, proactive, and predictive). We collected a corpus of 490 papers published from 2014 to 2023 by searching in Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Springer, and ACM digital library databases. After a systematic review, 17 reactive models, 17 proactive models, and 14 predictive models were shortlisted and compared. A taxonomy of ideas behind the proposed models was also created for each of these categories of fault-tolerant solutions. Additionally, it examines how fault tolerance capability is incorporated into popular big data processing tools such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Flink. Finally, promising future research directions in this domain are discussed.},

Besides its dynamic nature, which means that resources may enter and leave the environment at any time, many distributed systems applications will be running in an environment where faults are more likely to occur due to their ever-increasing scales and the complexity. Due to diverse faults and failures conditions, fault tolerance has become a critical element for distributed computing in order for the system to perform its function correctly even in the present of faults. Replication techniques primarily concentrate on the two fault tolerance manners precisely masking the failures as well as reconfigure the system in response. This paper presents a brief survey on different replication techniques such as Read One Write All (ROWA), Quorum Consensus (QC), Tree Quorum (TQ) Protocol, Grid Configuration (GC) Protocol, Two-Replica Distribution Techniques (TRDT), Neighbour Replica Triangular Grid (NRTG) and Neighbour Replication Distributed Techniques (NRDT). These techniques have its own redeeming features and shortcoming which forms the subject matter of this survey.},

Software-Implemented Hardware Fault Tolerance approaches have been developed to improve system dependability regarding hardware faults without resorting to custom hardware solutions. However, these come at the expense of making the satisfaction of the timing constraints of the applications/activities harder from a scheduling standpoint. This article surveys the current state-of-the-art of fault tolerance approaches when used in the context of real-time systems, identifying the main challenges and the cross-links between these two topics. We propose a joint scheduling-failure analysis model that highlights the formal interactions among software fault tolerance mechanisms and timing properties. This model allows us to present and discuss many open research questions with the final aim to spur future research activities.},

In recent times, Fog computing has generated significant research interest for IoT applications, however, there is still a lack of ideal approach and framework for supporting parallel and fault-tolerant execution of the tasks while collectively utilizing the resource-constrained Fog devices. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an Akka framework based on the Actor Model for designing and executing the distributed Fog applications. The Actor Model was conceived as a universal paradigm for concurrent computation with additional requirements such as resiliency and scalability, whereas, the Akka toolkit is a reference implementation of the model. Further, to dynamically deploy the distributed applications on the Fog networks, a Docker containerization approach is used. To validate the proposed actor-based framework, a wireless sensor network case study is designed and implemented for demonstrating the feasibility of conceiving applications on the Fog networks. Besides that, a detailed analysis is produced for showing the performance and parallelization efficiency of the proposed model on the resource-constrained gateway and Fog devices.},

Less, however, has been known about real-world, industry-scale deployment, experience, and insights about data races. Golang (Go for short) is a modern programming language that makes concurrency a first-class citizen. Go offers both message passing and shared memory for communicating among concurrent threads. Go is gaining popularity in modern microservice-based systems. Data races in Go stand in the face of its emerging popularity. In this paper, using our industrial codebase as an example, we demonstrate that Go developers embrace concurrency and show how the abundance of concurrency alongside language idioms and nuances make Go programs highly susceptible to data races. Google's Go distribution ships with a built-in dynamic data race detector based on ThreadSanitizer. However, dynamic race detectors pose scalability and flakiness challenges; we discuss various software engineering trade-offs to make this detector work effectively at scale. We have deployed this detector in Uber's 46 million lines of Go codebase hosting 2100 distinct microservices, found over 2000 data races, and fixed over 1000 data races, spanning 790 distinct code patches submitted by 210 unique developers over a six-month period. Based on a detailed investigation of these data race patterns in Go, we make seven high-level observations relating to the complex interplay between the Go language paradigm and data races.},

However, the language has not been developed or maintained for the last 25 years, which makes it difficult to maintain the programs which currently has a code base in Occam. As changing the entire code base for such systems will prove both expensive and time consuming, it is desirable to find an easy and secure way to translate Occam programs into another programming language.This paper lays the foundation of a transpiler from Occam to the newer programming language Go using Haskell. Go is a modern programming language which also implements many of the CSP principles found in Occam, making it a suitable target.The transpiler is implemented for a subset of Occam including only basic functionality, and is successful in translating simple programs from Occam to Go, showing that it is indeed possible to automatically translate Occam programs into Go.},
